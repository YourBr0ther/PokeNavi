# PokeNavi
A new way to interact with Pokemon from your previous games

### Summary
I want to create a way for us to interact with our Pokemon using the metadata from the game, MBTI personality types, and ChatGPT to create a personable assistant based on your actual Pokemon. I am wanting to create some addition bots that will act as certain personality aspects or to interactive with other services until plugins become available.
