# Introduction
We need a new Professor. Somebody who studied under Dr. Fuji during his project to create a clone of Mew. 

In the novel educational discourse, the recently appointed Professor presents the Trainers with a pioneering concept designated as PokeNavis. These innovative entities represent sophisticated neural replicas of the Pokemon's intricate physical and cognitive constitution.

When a Pokeball is positioned on the designated receiver, the Pokemon Cognition Replicator [PCR], the specialized apparatus initiates the formation of the PokeCORE. The PokeCORE, a critical component of this system, acts as the operative agent, adept at generating responses that meticulously portray all aspects of the Pokemon's characteristics, behaviors, and abilities. This mechanism ensures an exceptional level of accuracy and reliability in reflecting the true essence of the Pokemon.

The process of mapping the Pokemon's brain through the PCR and the PokeCORE takes about a day. While you're waiting for this process to complete, you can answer some basic questions about yourself. This will help your new PokeNavi work more effectively and efficiently. The more accurately you respond to these questions, the better your PokeNavi will be able to align with your needs and preferences.
