# Introduction
We need a new Professor. Somebody who studied under Dr. Fuji during his project to create a clone of Mew. 

In the novel educational discourse, the recently appointed Professor presents the Trainers with a pioneering concept designated as PokeNavis. These innovative entities represent sophisticated neural replicas of the Pokemon's intricate physical and cognitive constitution.

When a Pokeball is positioned on the designated receiver, the Pokemon Cognition Replicator [PCR], the specialized apparatus initiates the formation of the PokeCORE. The PokeCORE, a critical component of this system, acts as the operative agent, adept at generating responses that meticulously portray all aspects of the Pokemon's characteristics, behaviors, and abilities. This mechanism ensures an exceptional level of accuracy and reliability in reflecting the true essence of the Pokemon.

The process of mapping the Pokemon's brain through the PCR and the PokeCORE takes about a day. While you're waiting for this process to complete, you can answer some basic questions about yourself. This will help your new PokeNavi work more effectively and efficiently. The more accurately you respond to these questions, the better your PokeNavi will be able to align with your needs and preferences.

## Interaction
Once your Pokemon wakes up from their digital sleep, you'll be able to interact with them. They'll be able to see the real world through a small camera on your visor and stay up-to-date with real-world happenings thanks to an internet connection. Plus, we've given each Pokemon the ability to speak. This feature uses simulated vocal cords that are designed to reflect the unique sound, or cry, of each Pokemon.

## Idle Play
In contrast to the stasis-like condition experienced within a Pokeball, we've engineered an immersive virtual environment for the Pokemon to engage with. This environment is tailored to their specific type, fostering a more natural and familiar setting. Moreover, it will be populated with a diverse array of other Pokemon that have similarly been integrated into this simulation. This construct allows for a dynamic, interactive experience, promoting the well-being and continued growth of each Pokemon during their time in the digital realm.

## Dreams
Given that Pokemon within the digital realm do not physically tire and therefore do not require sleep in the traditional sense, we've developed a synthetic slumber state to emulate their species-specific sleep patterns, thereby preserving their inherent circadian rhythm. If you shared your typical waking hours with the PCR during the replication process, your Pokemon will adhere to a synchronized sleep schedule, irrespective of their type.

During this artificial slumber, your Pokemon will engage in a dreaming phase, a simulation of their most salient thoughts and emotions. This process allows for the organization and expression of their innermost sentiments, providing an invaluable opportunity for trainers to gain profound insights into their Pokemon's psyche. Consequently, this deeper understanding will aid in fostering a stronger, more meaningful connection with your Pokemon.
