# Inventory System
I want to create a way to store all of your Pokemon in the PC and then be able to pull out up to 6 Pokemon at one time. This will keep the menu system light and won't make it too hard to manage too many Pokemon. It will keep the loading to a minimum as well. 

# Mimic the Pokemon PC
I want to be able to show all of the Pokemon in the PC via their sprites. On a click, they will be able to select up to 6 pokemon and then a confirm button will appear. The click will darken a rounded square around the selected Pokemon. It will be just an iFrame that pops up that pauses the current chats. Then, it will reload the screen with the new selected Pokemon

# Hobby change / Nickname change? 
I was floating the idea of maybe being able to change over the hobbies of the Pokemon and the Nicknames. I feel like the Nicknames are more likely to be changable. It would just require updating the JSON and communicating to the bot that it has changed. I don't need to worry about the history as it will eventually fall off and I can focus on a memory being active until it is time for that to fall off. 

# Other features
I can't think of anything else that I would need/ want for the inventory system. I feel like this is probably going to be enough to make it function and to get the needs complete. I don't want to make it too complicated and I don't want to make it confusing.
