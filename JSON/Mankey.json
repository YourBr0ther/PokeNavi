When it starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it’s a sure sign of anger. However, since this happens instantly, there is no time to flee. Light and agile on its feet, and ferocious in temperament. When angered, it flies into an uncontrollable frenzy. Extremely quick to anger.

When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However, because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly, it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath. It can spontaneously become enraged. Everyone near it clears out as it rampages, and the resulting loneliness makes it angrier still. Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep, but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it to wake up—which infuriates it all over again. The smallest of things could cause it to lose its temper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress, this Pokémon can live a long time. If one gets angry, all the others around it will get angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop of Mankey. An agile Pokémon that lives in trees.
