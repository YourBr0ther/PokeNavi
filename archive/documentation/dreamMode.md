# Dreams
Given that Pokemon within the digital realm do not physically tire and therefore do not require sleep in the traditional sense, we've developed a synthetic slumber state to emulate their species-specific sleep patterns, thereby preserving their inherent circadian rhythm. If you shared your typical waking hours with the PCR during the replication process, your Pokemon will adhere to a synchronized sleep schedule, irrespective of their type.

During this artificial slumber, your Pokemon will engage in a dreaming phase, a simulation of their most salient thoughts and emotions. This process allows for the organization and expression of their innermost sentiments, providing an invaluable opportunity for trainers to gain profound insights into their Pokemon's psyche. Consequently, this deeper understanding will aid in fostering a stronger, more meaningful connection with your Pokemon.

## Fleshed out
Every night between 1 and 3 AM. There is a chance each Pokemon can experience a dream. 

### Dream Examples
* The Pokemon went to X location and did Y.
* The Pokemon thought about a recent memory of the trainer
* The Pokemon have a nightmare
* The Pokemon have lucid dreams
* The Pokemon can dream about their Hobby
* The Pokemon can dream about a problem the trainer was trying to solve

## UI
If the trainer logs in at a certain time, they will be able to influence the dreams of the Pokemon. A different UI can appear that allows them to suggest what the Pokemon will dream about. It will be an iframe that as the dream examples above. I will shorten the verbage so it is easier to select from. Probably a 2 by 3 column. Then, the trainer will be able to jump into conversation mode. The sleep time could be a mystery that is slightly different for each Pokemon. Maybe it is displayed on the inventorySystem after it is discovered. 

## What happens?
Dream mode starts
Each Pokemon will run through their dream sequence and 1-4 questions will be asked based on the dream. Then, the answers of those questions will be added to their short term memory
